1)Project Title

Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

2) Short Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing energy consumption trends across multiple cities for the year 2023. The dashboard highlights top energy providers, monthly usage fluctuations, cost analysis by category, and energy source distribution, enabling data-driven decision-making for sustainable energy management.

3)Tech Stack

Power BI – Dashboard development & visualization

Excel / CSV / SQL Database – Data storage and integration

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures & KPIs

Power Query – For data cleaning and transformation

4)Data Source

Simulated/collected data on energy consumption, costs, providers, and energy sources.

Input formats: CSV / Excel sheets or SQL tables.

Dataset includes attributes like energy provider, city, month, energy usage category, current, voltage, cost, and source type.

5) Key Features

Top 5 Energy Providers Analysis – Comparison of total current generated and total voltage.

Monthly Consumption Trends – Line chart showing seasonal variations in energy consumption.

Usage Category Insights – Breakdown of consumption & costs across commercial, industrial, residential, transportation, and government sectors.

Energy Source Distribution – Donut chart of energy mix (solar, nuclear, biomass, wind, natural gas).

KPIs Overview – Total cities covered, total energy savings, and overall energy consumption in 2023.

Interactive Filters – Users can filter by multiple selections and year for customized insights.

6) Highlights

Provides a comprehensive overview of energy management in 5 cities.

Identifies peak and low consumption months to optimize energy supply.

Highlights cost-efficiency gaps across usage categories (e.g., transportation having higher cost than consumption).

Shows the diversification of energy sources, with solar contributing the largest share.

Useful for government agencies, energy companies, and sustainability analysts to make strategic decisions.
